# 👋 Hey, I’m Cody Petersen

Welcome!  
I’m a long-time Network Administrator currently pivoting into **development** and ultimately, **automation**.

This GitHub is new — because I wanted a clean start for this next chapter of my career.

---

### 🧭 What I’m Focused on Right Now

- Learning **Python**, **Java**, and **SQL**
- Building small tools for network automation
- Working through backend frameworks like **Spring** and **Django**
- Pushing my first real projects (stay tuned!)
- Finishing my Bachelor's in Software Engineering through WGU (almost done!)

### 🚀 Why This Account Looks Empty (For Now)

I’ve spent years fixing production issues in real-world IT environments.  
But now I’m building from scratch on the dev side — **and I want this space to reflect my actual progress.**  
Every commit going forward will represent something I learned, built, or broke and fixed.

### 🧰 Coming Soon

- **Python automation scripts**  
- **Projects from my WGU Software Engineering coursework**  
- **Network tools and infrastructure experiments**
